    %   sig < 0 indicates preference for robustness.
    %   sig = -1/theta where theta is the robustness multiplier.
    % Note that because this is a MINIMUM problem, the convention
    % is that Q and R are `positive definite' matrices (subject to the usual
    % detectability qualifications).

    % olrprobust solves the problem by tricking it into a stacked olrp problem.
    % as in Hansen-Sargent, Robustness in Macroeconomics, chapter 2.
    % The optimal control with observed state is
    %  u_t = - F x_t
    %
    %  The value function is -x'Px; note that the program returns a positive
    %  semi-definite P. Pt is the matrix D(P) where D(.) is the operator
    %  described in Hansen-Sargent.  The conservative measure
    %  of continuation value is -y' D(P) y = -y' Pt y,
    %  where y=x', next period's state.
    %  The program also returns a worst-case shock  matrix K
    %  where w_{t+1} = K x_t is the worst case shock.
